# Wireless-Sensor-Network
This project is a deployment of a wireless sensor network. This network is including two sub-networks, which communicate by 433 MHz and 315 MHz frequency modules. Each sub-network including nodes(sensors) and a leader. The nodes of each network are considered to send their data to their leader (star protocol).  the leaders communicate with each other in 2.4 GHz frequency by the NRF24L01+ module. Finally, the head cluster (leader of leaders) of this network send the processed data to the Things Speak clouds by ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to monitor them. the devices are based on the Arduino nano development boards.
